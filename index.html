            <p>This is a photo of the Andromeda Galaxy, which is 2.5 million light-years away from us and is the closest galaxy to our Milky Way. In 1764, it was cataloged as the 31st entry in the Messier Catalog of star clusters and nebulae by the astronomer Messier, hence the name M31.
            The white bright spot on the left side of M31 is a dwarf galaxy called M32, which has been captured by M31's gravity. <br>
